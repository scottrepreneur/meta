Scott Herren (scottrepreneur)  
Product champion and developer

Hi Genesis DAO community, my name is [Scott Herren](https://www.scottherren.com/) and I'm a developer, data analyst, and community builder. I helped hack on [PoolTogether](https://www.pooltogether.us/) at EthDenver and some community development projects with MakerDAO. I'm super excited about [DAO subscriptions](https://github.com/austintgriffith/token-subscription) and an eventually [decentralized state](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8372356)_(no affiliation)_. I'm also a member of [YangDAO](https://dao.yangdao.org), a Moloch DAO.

I would like to participate in the Genesis DAO and help integrate DAOStack into other platforms to continue growing the DAO ecosystem.
